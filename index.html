                    northern India. The Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahān (reigned 1628–58)
                      to immortalize his wife Mumtaz Mahal (“Chosen One of the Palace”), who died in childbirth 
                      in 1631, having been the emperor’s inseparable companion since their marriage in 1612. India’s

                       southern (right) bank of the Yamuna (Jumna) River. Agra Fort (Red Fort), also on the right bank of 
                       the Yamuna, is about 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the Taj Mahal.

                <h4>Golkonda Fort (Telengana)</h4>
                <p>It was initially called Shepherd's Hill (Golla Konda in Telugu). According to legend, a shepherd boy came across an idol on this rocky hill.[citation needed] The information was conveyed to the ruling Kakatiya king, who constructed a mud fort around this holy spot. The Kakatiya ruler Ganapatideva 1199–1262 built a hilltop outpost—later known as Golconda Fort —to defend their western region.[2] Rani Rudrama Devi and her successor Prataparudra strengthened the fort further.[3][4] Golconda Fort was first built by Kakatiya dynasty as part of their western defenses along the lines of Kondapalli Fort.

                    After 200 years, Bahmani rulers took possession of the fort. Under the Bahmani Sultanate, Golconda slowly rose to prominence

                <h4>Konark Sun Temple (Odisha)</h4>
                <p>
                    The name Konark (Koṇarka) derives from the combination of the Sanskrit words Koṇa (corner or angle) and Arka (the sun).The context of the term Kona is unclear, but probably refers to the southeast location of this temple either within a larger temple complex or in relation to other sun temples on the subcontinent.The Arka refers to the Hindu sun god Surya.

The Sun temple of Konark, the Puri Jagannth temple and the Lingaraj temple of Bhubaneswar form a bilateral triangle. Konark temple forms one Koṇa (angular point of the triangle)
